Jacks use screw threads or hydraulic pistons to make linear power for heavy loads. Mechanical, hydraulic, thread, and smoke jacks are all types of jacks that are sold. Car jacks need mechanical force, which makes them hard for older drivers and women to use. Before people can safely use car jacks, they need to be created and made better. The main goal of the study is to make a safer system and make things easier for consumers, women, and the old. First, a list of common manual jack faults is made. the study of jacks tries to figure out what they are. Next, come up with ideas for how to solve the problems. We look at finished work to get better at what we do. The project is tried in ways that have already been planned. The project will be made better to make sure it works out. The results of this project are based on the idea that it can fix problems from the past. People are likely to like this electric jack technology, as they have other new technologies recently.
