# Definitions and Declarations

1. Include Directive:

   - `#include <SoftwareSerial.h>`: This line includes the SoftwareSerial library, enabling serial communication on digital pins of the Arduino other than the default RX/TX pins.

2. Constants and Variables:

   - `const int ledPin1 = 13;`: Declares a constant integer `ledPin1` and assigns it the value 13. This is the pin number where the first LED is connected.
   - `const int ledPin2 = 12;`: Similar to `ledPin1`, but for the second LED.
   - `const int rxPin = 1;`, `const int txPin = 0;`: Define pins for RX (receive) and TX (transmit) for the SoftwareSerial Bluetooth communication. However, these are usually the hardware serial pins, which might be an issue.
   - `const int infraRed = 11;`: Pin number for the infrared sensor.
   - `const int ldrPin = A0;`: Analog pin number for the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR).
   - Motor control pins: `ENL`, `ENR`, `LPWM`, `RPWM` are defined for controlling a motor driver.

   - `int ldrValue = 0;`: An integer variable to store the LDR sensor readings.
   - `int threshold = 1000;`: Threshold value for light sensitivity.
   - `SoftwareSerial bluetooth(rxPin, txPin);`: Creates a SoftwareSerial object named `bluetooth` using the previously defined RX and TX pins.
   - `char Incoming_value = 0;`: A character variable to store the incoming data from the Bluetooth module.
   - `bool motorRunning = false;`: A boolean variable (unused in the code) intended to track the motor's running state.

# `setup()` Function

This function runs once when the Arduino is powered up or reset. It is used to set up the environment.

- `Serial.begin(9600);`: Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 bits per second.
- `pinMode(..., OUTPUT);`: Sets the mode of various pins (LEDs, motor control pins) as output. This is necessary to control these components.
- `pinMode(infraRed, INPUT);`: Sets the infrared sensor pin as input to read its state.
- `pinMode(ldrPin, INPUT);`: Sets the LDR pin as input to read light levels.

# `loop()` Function

This function contains code that runs continuously after the `setup()`.

1. Reading LDR Value:
   - `ldrValue = analogRead(ldrPin);`: Reads the analog value from the LDR sensor.

2. Light Level Checking and LED Control:

   - If `ldrValue` is greater than `threshold`, it means the environment is dark, and the code turns off LED1 and turns on LED2. Otherwise, LED1 is turned on, and LED2 is turned off.

3. Bluetooth Communication Handling:

   - If there's incoming data on the Serial port, it reads one character and stores it in `Incoming_value`. It also sends a command to enable the motor driver.

4. Motor Control Based on Bluetooth Command:

   - If `Incoming_value` is `'1'`, it checks the infrared sensor.
     - If the IR sensor detects an object (reads LOW), the motor is moved clockwise.
     - If no object is detected, the motor is stopped.
   - If `Incoming_value` is `'0'`, similar logic applies but for moving the motor anticlockwise.

The `loop()` function thus orchestrates the light-responsive behavior and motor control based on Bluetooth commands and IR sensor readings. The use of `digitalWrite()` and `analogWrite()` functions controls the LEDs and motor speed/direction, respectively.
